    \section{Objective}

        On a whim, I decided to try my hand at making a bot for the voice and text chat service Discord. I quickly became very absorbed with it and

    \section{Technologies}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Discord Bot API (RESTful)
            \item DiscordPHP (client for interacting with the API)
            \item Ubuntu Server
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item API proxy and static file serving
                    \item SSL Security: LetsEncrypt
                    \item Store Tokens Securely
                    \item Process Management
                \end{itemize}
            \item PHP 7.1
            \item Asynchronous functions through Promises interface
            \item Git

        \end{itemize}




    \section{What I hope to learn}

        I hope to become more familiar with PHP (especially PHP 7, which is new to me, having used 5.4 extensively). I would also like to improve the style of my code to meet the PHP Style Recommendations (PSRs). Namespacing and dependency management is also an important part of modern PHP development, so I would like to learn how to leverage Composer to manage dependencies, namespaces, and class autoloading.

        I will need to set up and maintain a server for my bot, so I hope to learn how to create a stable, reliable, self-healing management system for the main bot process.




    \section{Proposed Features and Points}

        \begin{itemize}



        \end{itemize}




    \section{Grading Scale}

        50 points total.

        45+ =$>$ A

        40+ =$>$ B

        35+ =$>$ C

        30+ =$>$ D

        25+ =$>$ F

        The items that have a higher point value are the features that I am least familiar with and will require the most effort/learning on my part.
