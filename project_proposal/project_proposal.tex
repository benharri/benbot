    \section{Objective}

        On a whim, I decided to try my hand at making a bot for the voice and text chat service Discord. I quickly became very absorbed with it and

    \section{Technologies}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Discord Bot API (RESTful)
            \item DiscordPHP (client for interacting with the API)
            \item PHP 7.1
            \item Git
            \item Asynchronous code
            \item Promises interface
            \item Ubuntu Server
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Apache: API proxy and static file serving

        \end{itemize}

    \section{What I hope to learn}

        I hope to learn what it takes to create a compelling mobile experience. I want to know how to leverage cutting-edge technologies and engage users in our shared interest of beer. I see the future of web development going in the direction of RESTful APIs combined with a dynamic front-end built with reusable custom Web Components.

    \section{Proposed Features and Points}

                    \item Polymer "paper" elements [3]
                    \item Reusable Custom Web Components [5]

                    \item Offline Usage [5]
                    \item Service Workers [7]
                    \item Manifest.json: browsers will prompt users to "install" the web app [3]
                \end{itemize}

            \item Project Management [5]
                \begin{itemize}

        \end{itemize}

    \section{Grading Scale}

        50 points total.

        45+ =$>$ A

        40+ =$>$ B

        35+ =$>$ C

        30+ =$>$ D

        25+ =$>$ F

        The items that have a higher point value are the features that I am least familiar with and will require the most effort/learning on my part.
